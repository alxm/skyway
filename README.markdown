Skyway
======

This was my first attempt to make a [GP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP32) game back in 2005. I decided to publish this code for fun when I found it again in 2015 - I figured I'd have a kick looking at it again in another 10 years.

Skyway is a vertical shooter prototype written in [Fenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenix_Project). Your ship has to dodge and blast its way through an endless barrage of enemies and can get speed, health, and score bonuses.
